#### 4D Theater Wind Effect - DIY Home Theater Project

HTFanControl is an application meant to control fans in your home theater in order to create a wind effect during movies.

The program is meant to run in the background and be controlled through a web interface, typically from your smartphone.

### Wind Tracks

HTFanControl uses specially created wind track text files for each movie with coded time stamps and wind speeds.

A current database of wind track files created by the community is hosted [here](https://pastebin.com/u/SOWK).

These wind tracks can also be downloaded through the HTFanControl web interface as well.

#### Creating Wind Tracks

A companion app called WindTrackCreator has been created to help the process of making wind tracks for your movies.

You can find the WindTrackCreator project [here](https://github.com/nicko88/WindTrackCreator).
